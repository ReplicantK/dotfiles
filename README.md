# About
Most of the files in this repo are supposed to be found in the home folder as dot files. 
Symbolic links are created with the `setup.sh` script to standardize a working environment 
across different operating systems (i.e., GNU/Linux, macOS).

The following assumes that the (this) GitHub local repository is found in the home folder.

**Note:** when running the `setup.sh` script, a symbolic link named `.ideavimrc` is created in 
the home directory. This file is _not_ present in this repo but is linked to the vimrc file 
that exists in this repo. The purpose of this symbolic link is to enable the same settings for the 
IdeaVim plugin for IntelliJ.

## Installation
1. Make the `setup.sh` script executable if it is not already by running `chmod +x setup.sh`.
2. Run `setup.sh` with `./setup.sh`.
